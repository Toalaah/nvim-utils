# Adding Telescope Extensions

Since everyone has different needs in their workflow, we have opted **not** to
pre-configure any telescope extensions. You can, however, quite easily add your
own in only a couple lines of code.

Let's use the very popular `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` extension as an
example. From your configuration, simple declare the extension source.
Registration with `telescope` will be handled automatically.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  telescope.extensions.fzf-native = {
    # you can optionally specify `module` to override the lua module which is #
    # called during `telescope.load_extension(<module>)`. By default, the name of
    # the attribute set is used (in this case `fzf-native`, but since we
    # specified a module name `fzf` will be used instead)
    module = "fzf";
    src =
      pkgs.vimPlugins.telescope-fzf-native-nvim
      // {
        owner = "nvim-telescope";
        repo = "fzf-native.nvim";
      };
  };
}
```

You can, of course, use any source type for `src`, so fetchers such as
`pkgs.fetchFromGithub` will work as well.

```nix
{pkgs, ... }: {
  telescope.extensions.terraform_doc = {
    enable = true;
    src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "ANGkeith";
      repo = "telescope-terraform-doc.nvim";
      rev = "4b539fc9a9b647dddebe6b0ccc3eac2a23e3ddcf";
      hash = "sha256-8ry5Og/JLk0n3Ayx1YWUsQSJnA+FBXjilb3f1tKaE/4=";
    };
  };
  # these options are passed to `extensions` in `telescope.setup()`
  opts = {
    wrap = "wrap";
  };
}
```
